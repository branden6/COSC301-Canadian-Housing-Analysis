## Data Dictionary (Cleaned Table)

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `ref_date` | string | Date of observation (YYYY-MM) |
| `year` | int | Year extracted from ref_date |
| `month` | int | Month extracted from ref_date |
| `geo` | string | Geographic region (e.g., Canada, Ontario, Vancouver) |
| `price_category` | string | Index type: Total (house and land), House only, Land only |
| `value` | float | Price index value (base value: Dec 2016 = 100, so 38.2 would mean prices were about 38% if what they were in Dec 2016) |
| `status` | string | Data quality flag: `normal`, `E` (estimate), `..` (not available), `x` (suppressed) |

---

## Cleaning Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|---------|
| Dropped `SYMBOL`, `TERMINATED` | completely empty |
| Dropped `UOM`, `UOM_ID`, `SCALAR_FACTOR`, `SCALAR_ID`, `DECIMALS` | same value in every single row |
| Dropped `DGUID`, `VECTOR`, `COORDINATE` | internal Stats Canada IDs, not useful for analysis |
| Converted `VALUE` to float | raw CSV stores it as a string |
| Converted `REF_DATE` to datetime, split into year/month | easier to filter and group by time |
| Filled null `STATUS` with `"normal"` | null just means the data point is fine |
| Kept rows where `value` is missing | these are suppressed/unavailable data points, still want them tracked |
